## 5. Observability Architecture

The service integrates with a monitoring stack:

```text
FastAPI Service
      ↓
/metrics endpoint
      ↓
Prometheus (metrics collection)
      ↓
Grafana (dashboard visualization)
```

Monitoring provides:

* Total prediction count
* Request rate
* API latency (P95)
* System resource usage

---

## 6. Deployment

The service is:

* Containerized using Docker
* Built and pushed automatically via CI/CD
* Published to DockerHub
* Deployable using Docker or Docker Compose

To run locally:

```bash
docker build -t churn-risk-service .
docker run -p 8000:8000 churn-risk-service
```
